# Exploratory Analysis using Kaggle Data
This exploratory analysis shows the salary differences among the White House employees between Obama Administartion (8 years: 2009 - 2016) and Trump Admin (2017 - ).

Some interesting highlights: 
1. During the first year of Trump's presidency, we see slight increase in the mean salary (by ~ 12%)
2. The first year of Trump's presidency also sees the lowest in employee (although the year is not yet completed, so we may see more positions filled towards the end of 2017).
3. Although the gender information is not mentioned in the data set, the gender was guessed using the first name using "gender" package that encodes gender based on names and dates of birth. It seems that during Obama's year the balance between women/man is equal. We start to even see no. of women > men in the last year of Obama Admin. In 2017, under Trump Admin it is apparent that the opposite is observed (so far).
